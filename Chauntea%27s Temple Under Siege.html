With only time enough to catch their breaths, if that, <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Daisy.html" class="wikidpad">Daisy</a></span>, <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Balrick%20Stonefist.html" class="wikidpad">Balrick</a></span> and <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Batomius%20Plunk.html" class="wikidpad">Batomius</a></span> were quickly summoned to the roof of Greenest Keep. There they met <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Tarbaw%20Nighthill.html" class="wikidpad">Tarbaw Nighthill</a></span>, the Governor of Greenest who seemed to be in the throws of shock, as well as Daisy’s uncle, <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Rafferty.html" class="wikidpad">Rafferty</a></span>, and the man who appeared to be in charge, <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Escobert%20the%20Red.html" class="wikidpad">Escobert the Red</a></span>.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
After a quick homecoming, the party was sent off once more to clear the secret passage into the Keep and secure a way in for those still trapped outside. They dealt with the swarm of rats that had made the tunnel their home quickly and returned with the good news. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
There was still, however, much to do, as <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Escobert%20the%20Red.html" class="wikidpad">Escobert</a></span> soon explained. He pointed to the east and west and gave the party two options – save the trapped and encircled civilians at the Temple of Chauntea or else save the town’s food supply at the mill. Pulled by the will of the two devout amongst them, the party opted to head to the temple. <br class="wikidpad" />

<br class="wikidpad" />
After arriving and a quick scouting of the situation, they found three groups of enemies were orchestrating the attack on the temple. One group, the largest, was trying to break down the front door with a battering ram. Another had opted for burning down the door at the rear – or at least smoking out the trapped civilians. The third group circled the perimeter, no doubt ensuring that no one managed to escape unseen.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
It was soon decided that the party would attack the rear group once the patrol had moved out of sight. They attacked swiftly, and most of the <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Dragon%20Cult.html" class="wikidpad">Cultists</a></span> lay dead before the kobolds had even realised anything was wrong. Not long after, all lay dead and the adventurers approached the door to announce their victory.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
With some effort, they eventually convinced the trapped Greenest locals to let them in, but it turned out to be too little too late. Only moments after they had entered and convinced the townspeople to flee, the doors quaked with a terrible blow. They would not hold out any longer, the party realised, so they readied themselves to defend the fleeing civilians – at least for as long as they could.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The ensuing battle was swift and decisive. For the briefest of moments, it seemed like the adventurers might be able to pull off a miracle, even as the fleeing civilians were cut down behind them. The cultist leader fell to a well-placed arrow and a magical orb of lightning, and the kobold threat didn’t immediately overrun their position. But then Balrick fell to a cultist’s blade and the front crumbled. Moments later, Batomius followed him as the wave of Kobolds rolled over the group. Daisy, the last standing, soon fell as well, with the screams of her townspeople still echoing in her ears.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Some time passed, and the heroes eventually awoke. They found themselves bound and looted, but otherwise unharmed, and still in the temple they had fallen in. A masked figure entered the room and it was immediately obvious to them all that here was the cult’s leader. He wore a red dragon mask and purple robes, and all in attendance acted towards him with respect. It was a first glimpse – or so they thought – at the face of their enemy. And then the man removed his mask to reveal a disturbingly familiar face. <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Severin%20Silrajin.html" class="wikidpad">Severin Silrajin</a></span> smiled as he saw them, and greeted them as friends. With the same smiling face, he ordered the executions of the kobolds who had harmed them. He asked for their aid, and even offered them a place in his organization. He had come to Greenest to recover something stolen from him and would leave in peace if it, amongst the rest of Greenest’s treasure, was handed over to him. <br class="wikidpad" />

With a bitter taste in their mouths, the group decided their only option was to help <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Severin%20Silrajin.html" class="wikidpad">Severin the Red</a></span>. It was, they reasoned, the only way any of the townspeople would survive the night. But they had their own condition for their help – to restore the two temples of the city to their pre-attack states. It was only then that Balrick learned of the fate of his father, <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Valen%20Stormbringer.html" class="wikidpad">Valen Stormbringer</a></span>. The blue dragon, <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Lennithon.html" class="wikidpad">Lennithon</a></span>, who had hounded the city during the attack, had attacked the Temple of <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Bahamut.html" class="wikidpad">Bahamut</a></span> with a vicious rage and had destroyed it completely. Valen had been inside the temple at the time and had perished there.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Balrick left the temple heartbroken, led by grief to where his father had fallen. Meanwhile, Daisy and Batomius headed to the keep in a desperate attempt to convince Escobert to agree to the Cult’s terms.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Balrick found the temple he had left 5 years ago destroyed and the man he had called father lying dead under rubble, almost as if he had been sleeping, but he knew his eyes would never again open. The grief of his loss – a loss of his home and his family, both, was tempered by a growing flame of anger. He built a pyre for his father and laid his soul to rest, and as the flames flickered and smoke guided his father’s soul to the afterlife, he swore an oath stronger than any other he could. He would avenge his father and his temple. He would destroy those who came to his home to destroy. He would become vengeance.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Batomius and Daisy, meanwhile, counseled caution to Escobert. The dwarf was full of bravado and refused plainly to surrender his keep, but the pair eventually found a compromise that seemed might be accepted by all parties. The treasury was looted, the <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Book%20of%20Dragon%20Rituals.html" class="wikidpad">Book of Dragon Rituals</a></span>, which <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Rafferty.html" class="wikidpad">Uncle Rafferty</a></span> had stolen, and the thief himself, were handed over to the Cult, and in exchange, the Cult left without any more bloodshed. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<p align=center> <img src="https://github.com/Batomius/TyrannyOfDragonsWiki/blob/main/Wiki%20Images/Rafferty's%20Letter%20200px.png?raw=true"><br class="wikidpad" />

<p align=left><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
It seemed, for a little while, like it all might finally be over, even if for the adventurers, it had only just begun. But, just as the survivors of Greenest prepared to take a breath of relief, a figure appeared in front of the keep, surrounded by a gaggle of Kobolds. It was a blue half-dragon by the name of <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Langdedrosa.html" class="wikidpad">Langdedrosa</a></span>, who brought with him four prisoners. They were the sister of <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Markguth.html" class="wikidpad">Sergeant Markguth</a></span>, a Greenest guardsman, and her three children. Langdedrosa declared he had an offer for the town. Send a warrior out to fight him, and he would let the prisoners go. Batomius insisted that he was breaking the terms of their agreement with Severin, but the blue half-dragon seemed disinterested in honouring any deal other than his own. Without any options available to them, a wounded and exhausted Balrick pushed himself to his feet. He would start his vengeance with this minion of the Cult, he decided, and marched out to accept the duel.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Balrick the Paladin of Bahamut, on his third day, faced off against the half-dragon, surrounded by a ring of kobolds. He struck out viciously with his hammer, a flare of divine fire leaping from his blade as he stuck his foe. It was a brilliant strike, in more than one way, and it forced the creature back. But then the dragon-man lunched forward, his great sword coming down with finality. With just one strike, he left Balrick dying on the floor. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />

<p align=left><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
It was, perhaps, the quickness of this defeat that saved the dwarf’s life. With disgust, Langdedrosa left the dwarf where he lay and told him to find him when he was stronger. He had the prisoners freed, then left with his kobold escort, wandering out into the wilderness.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Finally, the battle of Greenest came to an end. The town had been devastated, looted, and shamed. But they had survived. It was time to bury those who had not been so lucky, and, for our adventurers, time to decide who they wanted to be.<br class="wikidpad" />
