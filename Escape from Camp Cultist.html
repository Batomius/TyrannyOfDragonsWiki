<a name=".h0" class="wikidpad"></a><h2 class="wikidpad heading-level2">Escape from Camp Cultist</h2>
As <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Daisy.html" class="wikidpad">Daisy</a></span> started unlocking the last shackled prisoner, whatever brief respite they had been afforded came to a crashing end. One of the four sentries set to guard the prisoners looked over his shoulder, then urgently whistled to the others. The time for discussion had ended, and the time for action was now. Without hesitation, <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Batomius%20Plunk.html" class="wikidpad">Batomius</a></span> unleashed a barrage of magic missiles, killing one of the cultists before they could even turn around. Daisy scampered over and snatched up the man's fallen scimitar, while <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Balrick%20Stonefist.html" class="wikidpad">Balrick</a></span>, not realising the plan that had started to unfold, had fled some impressive distance before realising his mistake and turning back to fight.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
With only minor wounds, the group quickly overwhelmed their captors, perhaps the surprise of being attacked by their own prisoners saving the party from further trouble. with three dead, the last guard was knocked unconscious, and the team quickly constructed a makeshift plan to sneak out of the camp. Daisy was to scout ahead and guide them out, while Batomius used his magic to communicate with her silently and guide the other prisoners. Balrick carried their own prisoner over his shoulders, and Leosin watched over him as he did so.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Their efforts in sneaking out of the camp faired much greater than their efforts to sneak in. An alarm was only raised as they reached the outskirts of the fortifications, and this only served to lure attention away from where they were, and towards where they had been. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
They made it a safe distance from the camp before deciding to rest for the night. They were all exhausted, and no one complained much about sleeping. In the morning, however, their was some considerable debate, led by Batomius, to return to the camp. They had left without their possessions, including the wizard's Spell Book, which he insisted they return for. <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Unknown%20Half-Elf.html" class="wikidpad">Leosin</a></span> asked that the group help him return these others to <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Greenest.html" class="wikidpad">Greenest</a></span>, and promised to return with them when they had. Grudgingly, at least on Batomius' part, they agreed, and continued their journey to Greenest.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Upon reaching the town, they were met by <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Nesim%20Waladra.html" class="wikidpad">Nesim Waladra</a></span>, who took Leosin, who had collapsed an hour earlier, off to recover. Then, the party went to visit <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Tarbaw%20Nighthill.html" class="wikidpad">Governor Nighthill</a></span> with their prisoner and reported their partial success in their quest to <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Track%20Down%20the%20Cult.html" class="wikidpad">Track Down The Cult</a></span>. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Nighthill thanked the party for what information they could provide, but seemed disturbed by Balrick's attempts to perform enhanced interrogation on their prisoner. He advised them to take him to ac ell at the town's keep, where <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Escobert%20the%20Red.html" class="wikidpad">Escobert</a></span> would attempt to extract information in his own way. The Party agreed, and decided to let the man sleep the night in a cell to hopefully soften him up.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Upon waking, they went to visit Leosin, who was recovering slowly from his imprisonment. Nesim, however, insisted that he would not be ready to travel with the party any time soon, much less fight. The party decided to give the monk some more time, but after leaving the man to his rest, Nesim followed them and insisted that he would only be a burden to them in their attempt. He said that Leosin would listen to them if they insisted on it, but if they snuck away, he would try and follow them. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The party headed to the town after telling Nesim they would break the news to Leosin on their way to the camp. Balrick and Daisy went to interrogate the prisoner, while Batomius went to speak with Escobert and attempt to convince him to lend them equipment to aide them in retrieving their own. Batomius was, on the whole, fairly successful, while the other two were far less so. They obtained no information from the prisoner, and reported such to Batomius upon their meeting. Batomius decided to accompany them on a second effort, but quickly realised the futility of the attempt. They knew too little about their subject to make any meaningful progress.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Without any further information to arm themselves, they returned to Nesim's lodgings and broke the news to Leosin. He was not happy about it, but urged the party to <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Meet%20Leosin%20at%20Elturel.html" class="wikidpad">Meet Leosin at Elturel</a></span>, if they survived. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
After parting with Leosin and Nesim, the group made their way to the camp. As they grew closer, they made their way stealthily, however, they soon realised that they had returned too late. The camp had been abandoned.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
They stalked through the abandoned camp, finding that many of the tents had been burned, while other had simply been ransacked. It seemed the cult did not want to leave behind anything that could be valuable for someone trying to track them down. But they soon found that not all of the inhabitants of the camp had fled. A group of mercenaries had stayed behind, perhaps eager to find forgotten loot, or perhaps laying in wait for any returning adventurers. Whatever the reason, the party decided to avoid them, and headed further into the tent to search the tent where <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Frulam.html" class="wikidpad">Frulam</a></span> had been.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Upon reaching the tent, however, they found it empty. Whatever had been taken from them was no longer there. Disparate, they left the tent, Batomius considering that his Spell Book might be lost for good. Just as all hope seemed lost, Daisy spotted one of her arrows, broken in the dirt. She realised that her possessions must have been moved, and there was only one obvious place - the cave. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The party approached the cave eagerly, but, just as they drew close, Daisy stopped them. She had seen someone in the shadows inside. Balrick, with his superior vision, confirmed the same. A dwarf, he thought, and a half-elf had positioned themselves to guard the cave's mouth. There was no way they could enter the cave without being seen, but enter it they must. They prepared themselves for a fight, and hoped they could end it quickly enough that no one else would notice.<br class="wikidpad" />
