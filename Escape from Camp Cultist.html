As <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Daisy.html" class="wikidpad">Daisy</a></span> started unlocking the last shackled prisoner, whatever brief respite they had been afforded came to a crashing end. One of the four sentries set to guard the prisoners looked over his shoulder, then urgently whistled to the others. The time for discussion had ended, and the time for action was now. Without hesitation, <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Batomius%20Plunk.html" class="wikidpad">Batomius</a></span> unleashed a barrage of magic missiles, killing one of the cultists before they could even turn around. Daisy scampered over and snatched up the man's fallen scimitar, while <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Balrick%20Stonefist.html" class="wikidpad">Balrick</a></span>, not realising the plan that had started to unfold, had fled some impressive distance before realising his mistake and turning back to fight.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
With only minor wounds, the group quickly overwhelmed their captors, perhaps the surprise of being attacked by their own prisoners saving the party from further trouble. with three dead, the last guard was knocked unconscious, and the team quickly constructed a makeshift plan to sneak out of the camp. Daisy was to scout ahead and guide them out, while Batomius used his magic to communicate with her silently and guide the other prisoners. Balrick carried their own prisoner over his shoulders, and Leosin watched over him as he did so.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Their efforts in sneaking out of the camp faired much greater than their efforts to sneak in. An alarm was only raised as they reached the outskirts of the fortifications, and this only served to lure attention away from where they were, and towards where they had been. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
They made it a safe distance from the camp before deciding to rest for the night. They were all exhausted, and no one complained much about sleeping. In the morning, however, their was some considerable debate, led by Batomius, to return to the camp. They had left without their possessions, including the wizard's Spell Book, which he insisted they return for. <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Unknown%20Half-Elf.html" class="wikidpad">Leosin</a></span> asked that the group help him return these others to <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Greenest.html" class="wikidpad">Greenest</a></span>, and promised to return with them when they had. Grudgingly, at least on Batomius' part, they agreed, and continued their journey to Greenest.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Upon reaching the town, they were met by <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Nesim%20Waladra.html" class="wikidpad">Nesim Waladra</a></span>, who took Leosin, who had collapsed an hour earlier, off to recover. Then, the party went to visit <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Tarbaw%20Nighthill.html" class="wikidpad">Governor Nighthill</a></span> with their prisoner and reported their partial success in their quest to <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Track%20Down%20the%20Cult.html" class="wikidpad">Track Down The Cult</a></span>. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Nighthill thanked the party for what information they could provide, but seemed disturbed by Balrick's attempts to perform enhanced interrogation on their prisoner. He advised them to take him to ac ell at the town's keep, where <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Escobert%20the%20Red.html" class="wikidpad">Escobert</a></span> would attempt to extract information in his own way. The Party agreed, and decided to let the man sleep the night in a cell to hopefully soften him up.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Upon waking, they went to visit Leosin, who was recovering slowly from his imprisonment. Nesim, however, insisted that he would not be ready to travel with the party any time soon, much less fight. The party decided to give the monk some more time, but after leaving the man to his rest, Nesim followed them and insisted that he would only be a burden to them in their attempt. He said that Leosin would listen to them if they insisted on it, but if they snuck away, he would try and follow them. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The party headed to the town after telling Nesim they would break the news to Leosin on their way to the camp. Balrick and Daisy went to interrogate the prisoner, while Batomius went to speak with Escobert and attempt to convince him to lend them equipment to aide them in retrieving their own. Batomius was, on the whole, fairly successful, while the other two were far less so. They obtained no information from the prisoner, and reported such to Batomius upon their meeting. Batomius decided to accompany them on a second effort, but quickly realised the futility of the attempt. They knew too little about their subject to make any meaningful progress.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Without any further information to arm themselves, they returned to Nesim's lodgings and broke the news to Leosin. He was not happy about it, but urged the party to <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Meet%20Leosin%20at%20Elturel.html" class="wikidpad">Meet Leosin at Elturel</a></span>, if they survived. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
After parting with Leosin and Nesim, the group made their way to the camp. As they grew closer, they made their way stealthily, however, they soon realised that they had returned too late. The camp had been abandoned.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
They stalked through the abandoned camp, finding that many of the tents had been burned, while other had simply been ransacked. It seemed the cult did not want to leave behind anything that could be valuable for someone trying to track them down. But they soon found that not all of the inhabitants of the camp had fled. A group of mercenaries had stayed behind, perhaps eager to find forgotten loot, or perhaps laying in wait for any returning adventurers. Whatever the reason, the party decided to avoid them, and headed further into the tent to search the tent where <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Frulam%20Mondath.html" class="wikidpad">Frulam</a></span> had been.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Upon reaching the tent, however, they found it empty. Whatever had been taken from them was no longer there. Disparate, they left the tent, Batomius considering that his Spell Book might be lost for good. Just as all hope seemed lost, Daisy spotted one of her arrows, broken in the dirt. She realised that her possessions must have been moved, and there was only one obvious place - the cave. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The party approached the cave eagerly, but, just as they drew close, Daisy stopped them. She had seen someone in the shadows inside. Balrick, with his superior vision, confirmed the same. A dwarf, he thought, and a half-elf had positioned themselves to guard the cave's mouth. There was no way they could enter the cave without being seen, but enter it they must. They prepared themselves for a fight, and hoped they could end it quickly enough that no one else would notice.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<a name=".h6016" class="wikidpad"></a><h3 class="wikidpad heading-level3">Batomius' Journal Entry</h3>
I scrawl this missive on a scrap of dirty parchment and with a hastily foraged pen made from a local shrub. These, and the clothes on my back, are the sum-total of the possessions left to me, due to the very events I must now recount. If you, whoever you may be, future reader, finds within these words less of the ardor you might have found in previous entries – and I hope, future ones – I trust that you will understand why shortly.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Following our capture at the hands of the cult for a second time, it seemed whatever goodwill had been given us by Sevarin had run its course. We had been told of our execution with the dawn, and then had been left to our imprisonment and introspection. Daisy, by nature incapable of sitting still, it seems to me, quickly found herself with one hand free, and with Balrick’s assistance, managed to distract a cultist long enough to retrieve an earring from his pocket. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
As the sun vanished beyond the canyon’s walls, a hush came over the camp. For them, it was perhaps the sound of exhaustion. By all accounts, this attack had been a hasty one, and their retreat afterwards similarly so. But, for ourselves and the other imprisoned, it was the sound of the cost of failure. With just one misstep, we would find our executions brought forward with great efficiency. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Daisy worked tirelessly to free herself, and then Balrick and I. It was meticulous work, and, although she progressed with the steadfastness of the accomplished adept, every minute felt like an hour as we waited, conscious that a glance over the shoulder from any of our guards could spell disaster. We were lucky, perhaps, that that glance came just as Daisy started on the last prisoner’s restraints.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The man let out a whistle, yet we had seen him just as he had seen us. We leapt into action and quickly overwhelmed the four sentinels before they could alert the rest of the camp. We even managed to take one of them prisoner.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
It was with greater skill, or else greater luck, that we extricated ourselves from the camp we had so easily found ourselves imprisoned within. Along with ourselves, we escorted the cult infiltrator, Leosin, as well as three local farmers, to the relative safety of the forest. It was only at this point, now that imminent death was no longer a present concern, that our next course of action came to discussion. As you might have realised, we left the camp without our possessions, most valuable of which was my spellbook, followed only distantly by my staff. These were of course, not objects I would consider parting with, even under the most dire of circumstances. However, my opinion was overruled, both by my companions and Leosin, who requested that we help him to escort the others back to Greenest, and then he would return with us to the camp. Grudgingly, I agreed to his terms.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Our return to Greenest continued our ill-fortune. It turned out that Leosin’s injuries were greater than he had thought, and he would not be ready to travel for some time. After numerous attempts at gathering anything from our prisoner, we were left with naught. And, it would soon transpire, that by the time we decided to leave the town and return to the camp, just us three, that the world had moved on without us. The camp stood, in the most part, abandoned. The cult had gone, and only a few mercenaries yet remained.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Guided by Daisy, we crept through the darkened and burned tents, and made our way to where we had been brought before Frulam. Her tent, too, stood empty, and any of our possessions that may have been there were also absent. I would not deny a sense of hopelessness then – one that had been slowly corroding its way through my confidence since the loss of my tome. But, just as all seemed lost, Daisy spotted another clue in the dirt outside the tent. It was one of the bodkin arrows, of which she herself made us, that had fallen and broken in two. It seemed to us to lead in the direction of the caves at the back of the canyon. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
With a final hope, we approached the opening cautiously – and it was well that we did so. Just inside the cave mouth, shrouded in the darkness of its depths, two sentinels waited, watching for any that might come this way. For now, this is the end of my writings. If there are no further entries, it must be assumed that our attempt to enter the cave went rather poorly, and I am most likely now one of Kelemvor’s guests. If not, I hope I have good news to share with you, my reader, upon my next writing. <br class="wikidpad" />
