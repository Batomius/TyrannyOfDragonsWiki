<p align=center> Our Adventurers Reach Greenest<ul class="wikidpad normalindent"></div></ul>
As the sun began to set on the 29th of Eleint 1491, three travelers reached the <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="The%20Greengrove%20Inn.html" class="wikidpad">Greengrove Inn</a></span>, each weary from their day's travel and the unseasonable heat, but, for their own reasons, each looking forward to the road still ahead of them.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The first to arrive was <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Balrick%20Stonefist.html" class="wikidpad">Balrick Stonefist</a></span>, a Dwarven Paladin of the god <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Bahamut.html" class="wikidpad">Bahamut</a></span>. He'd spent the last five years traveling the countryside and proselytizing in the name of his god. As a reward for his efforts, he was granted the rank of Paladin, and recalled from his work. The very next day, he would make his  long-awaited return to his home in <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Greenest.html" class="wikidpad">Greenest</a></span>. He only had a brief moment to catch his breath and order a water, before the next wanderer entered.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Through the door came <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Batomius%20Plunk.html" class="wikidpad">Batomius Plunk</a></span>, an aging Human Wizard with a dark and mysterious past - even to him. He reached the Inn after spending some time wandering the countryside, and then heard tell of the <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Greenest.html" class="wikidpad">Greenest</a></span> harvest festival, which drew his curiosity. While displeased by the fist person he met at the Inn, the Hostler <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Galter%20Alden.html" class="wikidpad">Galter Alden</a></span>, he soon found himself enjoying a glass of wine in relative comfort, and was drawn into conversation with his Dwarven companion.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
And, finally, the youngest of our group,the Halfling Ranger <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Daisy.html" class="wikidpad">Daisy</a></span> arrived. In the spirit of her kind, she erupted with energy, even after all the traveling she had done that day. Not a word was spoken that received an answer by her, for she had already asked a new question before any answer could arrive. Daisy had set out in the opposite direction from the others and intended to venture to the town of <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Berdusk.html" class="wikidpad">Berdusk</a></span> to buy tobacco for her uncle. It soon became apparent that she was more interested in this supposed adventure, than the task given her.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
It was at this point that the newcomers were drawn into a game of dice. Daisy decided to gamble with her uncles funds, however, she turned out to be uncannily skilled - or perhaps just lucky - in her first game of <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Farkle.html" class="wikidpad">Farkle</a></span>, a game played with Six Dice, at least in these parts. She walked away the victor, taking all her winnings, as well as the dice set of <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Arthur%20Scatterseed.html" class="wikidpad">Arthur Scatterseed</a></span>. Batomius also found a flier asking for aide in relation to <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Goblin%20Attacks%20in%20Greenest.html" class="wikidpad">Goblin Attacks in Greenest</a></span>, which he took for later reading.<br class="wikidpad" />

<p align=left><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Finished with their game, Batomius and his companions began to talk to a mysterious figure in the corner, who sat all alone. Each being used to solitary travel, they found no issue with approaching a fellow traveler and starting a conversation. The man's name turned out to be <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Severin%20Silrajin.html" class="wikidpad">Severin Silrajin</a></span>, and his story was even more intriguing than his appearance. Severin was, but all accounts, quite the accomplished adventurer, and something more besides, at least it seemed to Batomius.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Not long after they group had started speaking, more mysterious travelers arrived. With Severin's assistance, the party identified the <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Purple%20Dragon%20Knight.html" class="wikidpad">Purple Dragon Knight</a></span>, <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Sir%20Isteval.html" class="wikidpad">Sir Isteval</a></span> along with an <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Unknown%20Cormyrean%20War%20Wizard.html" class="wikidpad">Unknown Cormyrean War Wizard</a></span>, both of which seemed to be taking pains to travel unnoticed and in disguise. Not long after these two departed the common room for their lodgings, a final traveler entered the inn. The <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Unknown%20Half-Elf.html" class="wikidpad">Unknown Half-Elf</a></span>, whose shifty behavior could only have been missed by the most socially-inept, drew the attention of Severin. Upon his instruction, the adventurers distracted the man and took the opportunity to investigate his bag, in which they found a strange dragon mask, worked in silver.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<p align=center> <img src="https://github.com/Batomius/TyrannyOfDragonsWiki/blob/main/Wiki%20Images/Cultist%20Mask%20200px.png?raw=true"><br class="wikidpad" />
The Mysterious mask carried by the half-elf.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<p align=left>After the arrival of the mask-carrying half-elf, Severin informed the others that he had changed his plans, and would now return to <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Greenest.html" class="wikidpad">Greenest</a></span> with them in the morning, if not sooner. Upon awaking, however, Balrick, Daisy, and Batomius found that Severin had already departed, and had left them a note claiming he could not wait and asking them to find him once they reached the town.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
With a sense of unease, the party left the inn in the company of the merchant <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Anfrie%20Vere.html" class="wikidpad">Anfrie Vere</a></span>, her guard <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Osmund.html" class="wikidpad">Osmund</a></span>, and the peddler <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Finkle%20Kadrinkle.html" class="wikidpad">Finkle Kadrinkle</a></span>.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Once they reached the town, however, it became clear that not all was well. Smoke billowed from many of the buildings, and a giant <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Lennithon.html" class="wikidpad">Blue Dragon</a></span> circled in the skies above. <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Dragon%20Cult.html" class="wikidpad">Kobolds</a></span> and <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Dragon%20Cult.html" class="wikidpad">Cultists</a></span> roved through the streets, and the townspeople fought their attackers, or else tried to flee. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The party leaped into action and raced towards the burning town. Just as they arrived at the first houses, however, they met their first challenge. A Greenest family fled their burning home, followed closely by a gang of Kobolds. <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Cuth%20Swift.html" class="wikidpad">Cuth</a></span> and <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Linan%20Swift.html" class="wikidpad">Linan Swift</a></span>, carrying their children, tried to flee the attack, but were quickly overwhelmed, and may very well have perished if not for the swift  intervention of the adventurers. Valiantly, our heroes overcame the Kobold threat, and even managed to ensure the Swift's escaped with their lives.<br class="wikidpad" />

The Injured Cuth's<br class="wikidpad" />
<p align=left>After their skirmish had subsided, they realized that the town was all but surrounded, and that those who had managed to escape the fighting were heading towards the fort at the center of the city. With little option, the adventurers and the Swifts decided to join the other survives, and fled to the fort, in the hopes that they would find safety, their still-living loved ones, and the man who seemed to be at the center of this all - Severin Silrajin.<br class="wikidpad" />

Day 1 of my great big adventure outside of Greenest. I couldn't wait to see what the big wide world had to offer, I've heard so many stories from merchants, mercenaries and adventures that my excitement was incontrollable. I'm not even sure I heard everything Uncle was saying when he gave me the task, as soon as I heard travelling to Berdusk was involved I grabbed the coin purse and ran out of the house with little time for him to finish his sentence. Tobacco, he wanted Berduskian Tobacco, I can’t forget that is my primary task, but exploring the city would be cool, maybe trying new and exotic foods, friends perhaps?, what about some nice wines, perfumes or even a nice rug, what about magical items? ooh maybe they have some exotic pets, or maybe they have engineers who have developed a cart for me to fly around the world with? No stop Daisy, focus, uncle often says I have trouble focusing and I need to stay focused. Beduskian Tobacco! <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
After a day's travel, I made it to Greengrove Inn. As I arrived this odd guy asked me for my horse, do I look like I’m tall enough to ride a horse? Anyways inside his slightly bigger brother but not really slightly was serving behind. I met two friends, I think at the bar. One old man who seems really really wise, I think he might even know more than Uncle, his name is Batomius. I don’t really know what he’s doing out here, I just know he’s following the road, he says it’s the same road as me even though I’m not sure how that can be because he was heading the other way. Also apparently all roads are connected, I have much to learn. The other friend Balrick is a bit more quiet, I think he’s a hero, a holy paladin who fights for justice, even though he said it was his first day, just like my mission to travel the world, we all have to start somewhere right? Anyways he’s short like me too which is cool, and he has really nice hair on his chin, with rings, ooh I liked the rings. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
After a few drinks and whatever meal they were tricked into eating we met another group of interesting fellas, they were really bad at their game though and embarrassingly I won with little effort and now I have a set of my own to play. There’s a guy we met, Severin, he seems nice, he showed us how to use our eyes properly, we watched as some more interesting folk entered the inn. He got very interested in the noble sir instamel (Editors Note: Sir Isteval) the (Purple ) dragon knight of comeia (Editors Note: Cormyr) and then rather spooked at the hooded man who arrived next, it’s okay though me and the old man snuck on him and saw his mask, it’s cool I guess but nothing to fret over. I was really excited to rest here the night and set out for Berdusk in the morning, but unfortunately, my friends found tobacco for me at the inn, which meant I didn't need to travel to Berdusk. At least it means I'll be back in time for the festival, but mannnn i really wanted to check out Berdusk.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Anyways the holy paladin and the wise man both had interest in returning with me to Greenest , so as their most reliable guide I bought the tobacco and set off with them in the morning, Severin said he would meet us in Greenest if we couldn’t find him in the morning. The walk back was cool, we stole some potatoes from farmer Richard again, angry farmer Richard is rather slow though and can never catch me, I don't know why he gets so mad over potatoes. Anyways we didn’t see him this time. I learnt that the paladin doesn't follow Chauntea, I thought she was the only god? Instead, his god is apparently a dragon? I’m unsure, dragons don't exist around these parts at least, only big birds. Wait hold that thought...is that a dragon? Greenest? The city is on fire?! I gotta go, my friends need me and it looks like there are plenty of kobolds to kill!<br class="wikidpad" />
