Our Adventurers Reach Greenest<ul class="wikidpad normalindent"></div></ul>
As the sun began to set on the 29th of Eleint 1491, three travelers reached the <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="The%20Greengrove%20Inn.html" class="wikidpad">Greengrove Inn</a></span>, each weary from their day's travel and the unseasonable heat, but, for their own reasons, each looking forward to road still ahead of them.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The first to arrive was <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Balrick%20Stonefist.html" class="wikidpad">Balrick Stonefist</a></span>, a Dwarven Paladin of the god [Bahamut]. He'd spent the last five years traveling the countryside and proselytizing in the name of his god. As a reward for his efforts, he was granted the rank of Paladin, and recalled from his work. The very next day, he would make his  long-awaited return to his home in <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Greenest.html" class="wikidpad">Greenest</a></span>. He only had a brief moment to catch his breath and order a water, before the next wanderer entered.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Through the door came <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Batomius%20Plunk.html" class="wikidpad">Batomius Plunk</a></span>, an aging Human Wizard with a dark and mysterious past - even to him. He reached the Inn after spending some time wandering the countryside, and then heard tell of the <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Greenest.html" class="wikidpad">Greenest</a></span> harvest festival, which drew his curiosity. While displeased by the fist person he met at the Inn, the Hostler <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Galter%20Alden.html" class="wikidpad">Galter Alden</a></span>, he soon found himself enjoying a glass of wine in relative comfort, and was drawn into conversation with his Dwarven companion.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
And, finally, the youngest of our group,the Halfling Ranger <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Daisy.html" class="wikidpad">Daisy</a></span> arrived. In the spirit of her kind, she erupted with energy, even after all the traveling she had done that day. Not a word was spoken that received an answer by her, for she had already asked a new question before any answer could arrive. Daisy had set out in the opposite direction from the others and intended to venture to the town of [Berdusk] to buy tobacco for her uncle. It soon became apparent that she was more interested in this supposed adventure, than the task given her.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
It was at this point that the newcomers were drawn into a game of dice. Daisy decided to gamble with her uncles funds, however, she turned out to be uncannily skilled - or perhaps just lucky - in her first game of [Farkle], a game played with Six Dice, at least in these parts. She walked away the victor, taking all her winnings, as well as the dice set of <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Arthur%20Scatterseed.html" class="wikidpad">Arthur Scatterseed</a></span>. Batomius also found a flier asking for aide in relation to <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Goblin%20Attacks%20in%20Greenest.html" class="wikidpad">Goblin Attacks in Greenest</a></span>, which he took for later reading.<br class="wikidpad" />

</div><br class="wikidpad" />
<p align=left> Finished with their game, Batomius and his companions began to talk to a mysterious figure in the corner, who sat all alone. Each being used to solitary travel, they found no issue with approaching a fellow traveler and starting a conversation. The man's name turned out to be <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Severin%20Silrajin.html" class="wikidpad">Severin Silrajin</a></span>, and his story was even more intriguing than his appearance. Severin was, but all accounts, quite the accomplished adventurer, and something more besides, at least it seemed to Batomius.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Not long after they group had started speaking, more mysterious travelers arrived. With Severin's assistance, the party identified the [Purple Dragon Knight], [Sir Isteval] along with an [Unknown Cormyrean War Wizard], both of which seemed to be taking pains to travel unnoticed and in disguise. Not long after these two departed the common room for their lodgings, a final traveler entered the inn. The [Unknown half-elf], whose shifty behavior could only have been missed by the most socially-inept, drew the attention of Severin. Upon his instruction, the adventurers distracted the man and took the opportunity to investigate his bag, in which they found a strange dragon mask, worked in silver.<br class="wikidpad" />
<p align=center> <img src="https://github.com/Batomius/TyrannyOfDragonsWiki/blob/main/Wiki%20Images/Cultist%20Mask%20200px.png?raw=true"><br class="wikidpad" />
The Mysterious mask carried by the half-elf.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<p align=left>After the arrival of the mask-carrying half-elf, Severin informed the others that he had changed his plans, and would now return to <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Greenest.html" class="wikidpad">Greenest</a></span> with them in the morning, if not sooner. Upon awaking, however, Balrick, Daisy, and Batomius found that Severin had already departed, and had left them a note claiming he could not wait and asking them to find him once they reached the town.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
With a sense of unease, the party left the inn in the company of the merchant <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Anfrie%20Vere.html" class="wikidpad">Anfrie Vere</a></span>, her guard <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Osmund.html" class="wikidpad">Osmund</a></span>, and the peddler <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Finkle%20Kadrinkle.html" class="wikidpad">Finkle Kadrinkle</a></span>.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Once they reached the town, however, it became clear that not all was well. Smoke billowed from many of the buildings, and a giant [Blue Dragon] circled in the skies above. [Kobolds] and [Cultists] roved through the streets, and the townspeople fought their attackers, or else tried to flee. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The party leaped into action and raced towards the burning town. Just as they arrived at the first houses, however, they met their first challenge. A Greenest family fled their burning home, followed closely by a gang of Kobolds. <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Cuth%20Swift.html" class="wikidpad">Cuth</a></span> and <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Linan%20Swift.html" class="wikidpad">Linan Swift</a></span>, carrying their children, tried to flee the attack, but were quickly overwhelmed, and may very well have perished if not for the swift  intervention of the adventurers. Valiantly, our heroes overcame the Kobold threat, and even managed to ensure the Swift's escaped with their lives.<br class="wikidpad" />

The Injured Cuth's<br class="wikidpad" />
<p align=left>After their skirmish had subsided, they realized that the town was all but surrounded, and that those who had managed to escape the fighting were heading towards the fort at the center of the city. With little option, the adventurers and the Swifts decided to join the other survives, and fled to the fort, in the hopes that they would find safety, their still-living loved ones, and the man who seemed to be at the center of this all - Severin Silrajin.<br class="wikidpad" />
