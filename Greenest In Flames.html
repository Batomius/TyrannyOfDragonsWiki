After some conversation with Severin, some more travelers arrived at the inn; a disguised [Purple Dragon Knight], [Sir Isteval] along with an [Unknown Cormyrean War Wizard]. These two were shortly followed by another strange arrival, an [Unknown half-elf], who carried with him a silver dragon mask.<br class="wikidpad" />

After the arrival of the mask-carrying half-elf, Severin informed the others that he would return to <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Greenest.html" class="wikidpad">Greenest</a></span>, as they all intended to do, and would journey with them in the morning, if not sooner. Upon awaking, however, Balrick, Daisy, and Batomius found that Severin had already departed, and had left them a note claiming he could not wait and asking them to find him once they reached the town.<br class="wikidpad" />

With a sense of unease, the party left the inn in the company of the merchant <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Anfrie%20Vere.html" class="wikidpad">Anfrie Vere</a></span>, her guard <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Osmund.html" class="wikidpad">Osmund</a></span>, and the peddler <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Finkle%20Kadrinkle.html" class="wikidpad">Finkle Kadrinkle</a></span>.<br class="wikidpad" />

Once they reached the town, however, it became clear that not all was well. Smoke billowed from many of the buildings, and a giant [Blue Dragon] circled in the skies above. [Kobolds] and [Cultists] roved through the streets, and the townspeople fled. The party leaped into action and raced towards the burning town. Just as they arrived at the first houses, however, they met their first challenge. A family fled their burning home followed by a gang of Kobolds. <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Cuth%20Swift.html" class="wikidpad">Cuth</a></span> and <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Linan%20Swift.html" class="wikidpad">Linan Swift</a></span>, carrying their children, tried to flee the attack, but were quickly overwhelmed, and may very well have perished if not for the intervention of the adventurers. Valiantly, our heroes overcame the Kobold threat and managed to save the Swift family.<br class="wikidpad" />

After their skirmish had subsided, they realized that the town was all but surrounded, and that those who had managed to escape the fighting were heading towards the fort at the center of the city. With little option, the adventurers and the Swifts decided to join the other survives, and fled to the fort, in the hopes that they would find safety, their still-living loved ones, and the man who seemed to be at the center of this all - Severin Silrajin<br class="wikidpad" />
