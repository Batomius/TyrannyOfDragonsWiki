<a name=".h0" class="wikidpad"></a><h2 class="wikidpad heading-level2">The Hunt for the Cult Begins</h2>
After the devastation of of the <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Greenest%20In%20Flames.html" class="wikidpad">Blue Dragon Attack</a></span>, the party took a fretful night of rest, each with their own worries, but united in their need to act. In the morning, they met again to discuss their next steps. It was without much conversation that they agreed to track down the cult. <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Daisy.html" class="wikidpad">Daisy</a></span> wanted to free her <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Rafferty.html" class="wikidpad">Uncle</a></span>, while <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Balrick%20Stonefist.html" class="wikidpad">Balrick</a></span> had sworn an oath of vengeance upon the <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Dragon%20Cult.html" class="wikidpad">The Cult</a></span>. Whatever <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Batomius%20Plunk.html" class="wikidpad">Batomius</a></span>' reasons, he kept them to himself. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
They soon met with <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Tarbaw%20Nighthill.html" class="wikidpad">Governor Nighthill</a></span>, who had discovered their intention to pursue the cult. He asked them to find the camp where they hid and gather information about their numbers, activities, and intentions. They agreed to <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Track%20Down%20the%20Cult.html" class="wikidpad">Track Down the Cult</a></span> and return with what information they could.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
But the problem remained that the party knew not where the cult had fled to. They turned to what they knew, as little as it was. It had become obvious, now, that the <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Goblin%20Attacks%20in%20Greenest.html" class="wikidpad">Goblins Attacking Greenest</a></span> had, in fact, been Cult raids, and so they first gathered information about where the attacks had been happening. Daisy mentioned that a friend of hers, <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Bobin.html" class="wikidpad">Bobin</a></span>, ventured far and wide in his hunt for pilfered potatoes. She believes that he might have seen clues as to the cult's movements. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Together, the party ventured to Bobin's home. As it turned out, Bobin was mute and communicated through a sign language that Daisy appeared fluent in. Through Daisy, the party questioned Bobin, and after some consideration, he gave a rough location where potatoes had been scarcer, as well as fewer animals had been seen. The location given was south of the <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Uldoon%20Trail.html" class="wikidpad">Uldoon Trail</a></span>, west of <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Greenest.html" class="wikidpad">Greenest</a></span>. With some small convincing, Bobin agreed to guide the group to the area he mentioned.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The Party were ready to go, but made a last minute stop at the <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Tervin.html" class="wikidpad">Greenest General Store</a></span>, run by a man called <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Tervin.html" class="wikidpad">Tervin</a></span>. At first, Tervin told them that the store was closed on account of the attack, but once he learned they meant to pursue the cult, he changed his mind. He gave them supplies and even refused payment for them, asking only that they attempt to <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Tervin%2527s%20Grandmother%2527s%20Necklace.html" class="wikidpad">Tervin's Grandmother's Necklace</a></span> that was stolen during the attack. The party agreed and made to leave the town.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Near the outskirts of Greenest, the party met another man, who approached them as if he knew them already. He was named <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Nesim%20Waladra.html" class="wikidpad">Nesim Waladra</a></span>, and he turned out to be <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Unknown%20Half-Elf.html" class="wikidpad">Leosin Erlanthar</a></span>'s apprentice. He asked if they had word of Leosin, and upon hearing that they had last seen him taken prisoner by the cult, requested that they <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Search%20For%20Leosin.html" class="wikidpad">Search For Leosin</a></span>. They agreed, feeling in some ways responsible for Leosin's detection at <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="The%20Greengrove%20Inn.html" class="wikidpad">The Greengrove Inn</a></span>. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Finally, the party left Greenest and followed Bobin to the area he had earlier indicated. Not long after, they found cultist tracks, and soon parted with Bobin as their path became one of danger. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Not far along the tracks they came upon a small camp of cultists. Three humanoids argued about cooking, while their six Kobold Companions sat at a distance, disinterested in the argument. The cultists had left their weapons to one side, and a plan immediately hatched in the minds of the party. Batomius asked Daisy if she could sneak close and steal the weapons once he caused a distraction, and she said she could. As she snuck into position, the wizard began to rile up the Kobolds by sending them messages in <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Draconic.html" class="wikidpad">Draconic</a></span>, pretending to be the Blue Dragon <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Lennithon.html" class="wikidpad">Lennithon</a></span>. With a little convincing, the Kobolds turned on their cultist companions, convinced that slaying them would grant them a great boon from the dragon. This had not gone unnoticed by the cultists, however, who dove for their weapons, only to find them vanished. Without further options, they fled towards their camp, with the Kobolds in hot pursuit.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The party followed the fleeing cultists, and soon found the result of that confrontation. Six Kobold bodies lay littered with bolts in a narrow pass. It had obviously been an ambush, and was likely to be the site of a second, yet even as they made steps to avoid being taken by surprise, the party were attacked.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
After a protracted battle, the last of the ambushing cultist's fled - a lone survivor with a large crossbow. Mostly uninjured, the party had little hope of killing him before he was out of site, and so resigned themselves to having a camp on alert to great them. They decided instead to rest and recover before continuing on their mission.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
After a short break, the party continued onward, trying their best to avoid detection as they drew ever closer to the camp. This was, unfortunately, doomed to failure, as close shave after close shave eventually resulted in drawing blood. They were quickly overwhelmed and taken prisoner by the Cult. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
After arriving at the camp, they were taken to see <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Frulam.html" class="wikidpad">Frulam</a></span>, <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Langdedrosa.html" class="wikidpad">Langdedrosa</a></span> and <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Rezmir%20the%20Black.html" class="wikidpad">Rezmir</a></span>, who had made the camp their homes. Another figure seemed to be dwelling in the tent behind them, however they did not exit or make themselves known. Frulam chastised the party, then advised they would be put to death at sunrise. They were then taken to be chained up to five-pointed metal contraptions reminiscent of the cult's own symbol. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
After being taken and imprisoned, the party found that they were not alone. Four other prisoners were already attached to the strange crucifixes, and Leosin was amongst their number. Balrick managed to heal some of his most severe wounds, and once the guards had retreated some, they spoke with him and exchanged information. Another of the prisoners was <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Farmer%20Richard.html" class="wikidpad">Farmer Richard</a></span>, a frequent victim of Daisy and Bobin's potato thefts. He and the others had been sent to a cave to do work every day, including packing stolen treasure, but Leosin had not. Rezmir had kept him chained up and tried to beat information out of him. She seemed concerned that he had predicted their attack on Greenest and wanted to know how.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
With little they could do, the group decided their best course of action was to cause a commotion and see what opportunities presented themselves. Daisy was able to get one arm free - enough, perhaps, to snatch that opportunity. They goaded a cultist to come over to them, and Daisy pick-pocketed an earing from him. After he had left, she set about the work of picking the rest of her manacles, and then those of the party. Lastly, she picked those of the other prisoners free, starting with Leosin. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
They were free of their imprisonment, yet it was only the first step along a long road to freedom. They were without weapons, without any of their gear, and still in the middle of an enemy encampment. What they did next would make the difference between life and death.<br class="wikidpad" />
