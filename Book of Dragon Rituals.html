The Book of Dragon Rituals is a mysterious text that contains numerous powerful and dangerous spells in an unknown language, all of which revolve around dragons. This rare artifact was in the possession of <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Rafferty.html" class="wikidpad">Uncle Rafferty</a></span>, who stole it from the <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Dragon%20Cult.html" class="wikidpad">Dragon Cult</a></span> when he fled their ranks. Up until that point, Rafferty had been translating the text for <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Severin%20Silrajin.html" class="wikidpad">Severin the Red</a></span>, but had long had a crisis of conscious about what he was doing, and had been intentionally delaying his progress. When the cult brought in foreign wizards to help in the task, Rafferty realized his time was up, and fled with the book to <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Greenest.html" class="wikidpad">Greenest</a></span>. This lead to the events of the <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Greenest%20In%20Flames.html" class="wikidpad">Blue Dragon Attack</a></span>.<br class="wikidpad" />

After the attack, the Book was handed back to Severin, and is now in his possession.    </body>
