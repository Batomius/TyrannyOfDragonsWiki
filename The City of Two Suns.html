<p align=left>The party were met at the gates of <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Elturel.html" class="wikidpad">Elturel</a></span> by a maille-clad solider, who menaced <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Kaboom.html" class="wikidpad">Kaboom</a></span>! with his blade. No evil creatures, he declared, were allowed within the city's walls. The soldier was called <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Hellrider%20Galwell.html" class="wikidpad">Galwell</a></span>, a Hellrider of the city. After some negotiation, he agreed to escort the party to his superior, <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Hellrider%20Captain%20Gwynera.html" class="wikidpad">Hellrider Captain Gwynera</a></span>, who might agree to let the kobold into the city.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The party, accompanied by Galwell, stopped at a stable called the <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Groom%20Gruff.html" class="wikidpad">The Two Suns Stable</a></span>, where they met <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Groom%20Gruff.html" class="wikidpad">Gruff</a></span> the stable groom. They paid for two nights board for their horses, and left, uncertain of the man's credentials. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Upon meeting Gwynera, the party pleaded their case, and were reluctantly given permission for Kaboom! to stay in a cell, where he would be safe from the <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Hellrider.html" class="wikidpad">Hellrider</a></span>s. Kaboom requested that the group do some shopping for him, and handed <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Daisy.html" class="wikidpad">Daisy</a></span> a list of usual ingredients.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The party then went to the markets, where they met <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Wolstan.html" class="wikidpad">Wolstan</a></span>, a local blacksmith. The party agreed to commission some armour-piercing arrows from the man, as well as some other simple product, but when it came to agreeing a price, <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Suor%20Lyth.html" class="wikidpad">Suor Lyth</a></span> insisted that part of the price could be covered by a 'favour', performed by himself. As it happened, Wolstan was of a mind to besmirch the name of a business rival, by the name of <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Leonora.html" class="wikidpad">Leonora</a></span>. Agreeing to his plan, Suor accepted a dagger of incredibly poor quality, which he was to claim he had bought from Wolstan's rival, and make a show of its poor craftsmanship.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Upon arriving at the rival blacksmith, however, Suor discovered that Leonora was a child of around 13 years of age. Quickly overcome with the thought that he might be doing the bidding of a less-than-honest businessman, Suor made a pantomime that, at a distance, might appear to be those of an unhappy customer. However, his words were those of a rather conventional conversation. He inquired about some prices, then bid the child good day. Passersby raised eyebrows at his performance, but little more.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Upon returning to Wolstan, Suor's temporary employer was pleased. He thanked him for helping to undermine the orphan's business, and promised delivery of Daisy's goods within the hour.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
After some further shopping, the party traveled to the large central park of Elturel, where they wandered amongst nature and enjoyed the sights. They met a man praying at a small shrine - an off-duty Hellrider - who told them a little of the city - including where they could find a man by the name of <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Ontharr%20Frume.html" class="wikidpad">Ontharr Frume</a></span>, who <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Unknown%20Half-Elf.html" class="wikidpad">Leosin</a></span> had told <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Nesim%20Waladra.html" class="wikidpad">Nesim</a></span> he would visit.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
On their way to leave the gardens, they witnessed the execution of three prisoners - one for witchcraft, and the other two for being [Yuan-ti] spies. The execution was carried out by harnessing the great power of Elturel's <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Elturel.html" class="wikidpad">Second Sun</a></span> by means of a large concave metal mirror. The mirror focused the light of the sun into a laser, and shortly after being directed at a person, would cause them to erupt in flames. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Horrified by what they had seen, the party discussed by who's will these punishments were carried out. A passerby informed them that it was carried out on the orders of <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="The%20High%20Observer.html" class="wikidpad">The High Observer</a></span>.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The party decided to leave the gardens and continue on their search for Leosin. On there way there, they stopped in at an [Elturel Alchemist] to purchase some more items on Kaboom!'s list. the alchemist told them that the [Elturel Apothecary] across the street might buy the remains of the [Manticore] that they slew, but warned them that she was a fraud. <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Batomius%20Plunk.html" class="wikidpad">Batomius</a></span> took her advise, and sold the apothecary the manticore's head, as well as its blood. Upon returning to the Alchemist, they discovered the last item on their list, a vial of acid, to be more expensive then anticipated. His companions looking at him, Suor offered a favour in exchange for the vial. Hesitantly, the alchemist said that, could they run the apothecary out of business, they could have the acid free of charge. The party agreed to the request, then continued on their way.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Finally, they arrived at their destination - a tavern by the name of [A Pair of Black Antlers].  There, they reunited with Leosin, who introduced them to Ontharr Frume, the leader of the <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Order%20of%20the%20Gauntlet.html" class="wikidpad">Order of the Gauntlet</a></span>. Leosin, speaking to them in private, advised the party of the importance of getting this man on side. He advised them to form a bond of trust with him, and then ask him for his help against the <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Dragon%20Cult.html" class="wikidpad">Dragon Cult</a></span>. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Rejoining their host with alcohol in hand, the party spent some time getting to know Ontharr before Daisy suggested a game of <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Farkle.html" class="wikidpad">Farkle</a></span>.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
With some sly luck, Suor came out on top of the game, with Batomius in a distant second, followed closely by Daisy. Ontharr, after a hot start, ended in dead last. Their host grew steadily more annoyed as he continued to fall further behind, and at the conclusion of the game, seemed deeply disconcerted at his loss. The party did their best to cheer him up, and with a laugh and a drink, he suggested another game - a drinking contest.<br class="wikidpad" />
