<p align=left>Upon their return to <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Greenest.html" class="wikidpad">Greenest</a></span>, <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Daisy.html" class="wikidpad">Daisy</a></span> and <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Batomius%20Plunk.html" class="wikidpad">Batomius</a></span> made their way to see <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Tarbaw%20Nighthill.html" class="wikidpad">Tarbaw Nighthill</a></span> and report their progress on <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Track%20Down%20the%20Cult.html" class="wikidpad">uncovering the cults plans</a></span>. As a reward for their work, Nighthill gave them a letter and told them to deliver it to <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Auntie%20Rosylnn.html" class="wikidpad">Auntie Rosylnn</a></span>, who would give them their reward. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
While on their way to return to Daisy's home, where they had left <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Kaboom.html" class="wikidpad">Kaboom</a></span> to rest, they ran into a strange silver Dragonborn, by the name of <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Suor%20Lyth.html" class="wikidpad">Suor Lyth</a></span>. This strange character claimed to be another follower of <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Bahamut.html" class="wikidpad">Bahamut</a></span>, and also claimed to have been sent to find them and fight the cult with them. He was to travel to <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Elturel.html" class="wikidpad">Elturel</a></span>, which gave the party pause, as they had not shared their destination with anyone.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
After some deliberation, they decided to journey together, and set of to visit Auntie Rosylnn, before setting off for Elturel.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Reunited with <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Nesim%20Waladra.html" class="wikidpad">Nesim</a></span>, and then Kaboom!, the party set off. Upon reaching Rosylnn's farm, they were treated to baked goods and blueberry tea, before eventually having their reward revealed. Rosylnn took them to her fields and revealed dozens of horses, any of which they could take as they pleased. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Daisy found herself a monstrous black draft horse, while Batomius took a rangy and aging gelding, that looked as though it might die before they reached Elturel. With that, they party left Rosylnn, and <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Greenest.html" class="wikidpad">Greenest</a></span>, behind.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
It was six days travel to Elturel, and, other than an encounter with a [Manticore], the travel was uneventful.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
On the sixth day, they found themselves standing outside the walls of Elturel, the next step in their adventure before them.<br class="wikidpad" />
