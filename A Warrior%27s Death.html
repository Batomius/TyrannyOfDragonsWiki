The party launched their attack swiftly. The two cultists stationed inside the caves mouth died quickly under arrow, spell and blade. <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Batomius%20Plunk.html" class="wikidpad">Batomius</a></span>, <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Daisy.html" class="wikidpad">Daisy</a></span>, and <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Balrick%20Stonefist.html" class="wikidpad">Balrick</a></span> peered into the thick gloom beyond them.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The cave continued onwards in front of them, but another route caught their eye. To their right. a hewn doorway sat, and, upon approaching it, voices could be heard beyond. The men beyond argued about taking their spoils of the loot, undoubtedly that taken from <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Greenest.html" class="wikidpad">Greenest</a></span> during the <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Greenest%20In%20Flames.html" class="wikidpad">Blue Dragon Attack</a></span>. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The party decided to try subterfuge, and attempted to impersonate other <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Dragon%20Cult.html" class="wikidpad">Cultists</a></span> as they entered, however, this disguise was quickly seen through, and a battle erupted. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
In the flurry of fighting, a cultist managed to escape, and, although the rest lay dead at their feet, the party knew they had little more time. They needed to find their possessions - and quickly.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
They pushed on through the corridor beyond their fallen enemies, and took a path that took them to a large bedchamber and other quarters. They searched the room quickly, and soon found their possessions, along with notes about the cult's plans, seemingly written by the cultist lieutenant, <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Frulam%20Mondath.html" class="wikidpad">Frulam</a></span>. With all the others, they also found Frulam's golden mask on her desk.<br class="wikidpad" />

With all they needed found, the group decided it was time they leave. But just as they made to do so, they discovered a trapdoor hidden under a rug. Hastily, they rolled the rug aside, and peered down into the darkness beneath their feet. What lay beyond this secret tunnel, they mused. Perhaps a bolt hole, or perhaps more information about what the cult was up to. Balrick declared his intent to descend, and made his way down the ladder as the others watched on tensely. Just as the dwarf reached the bottom rung, and arm lunged towards him and pulled him from their sight.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Rushing to follow their companion, Batomius and Daisy arrived in time to see Balrick face to face with the cultist <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Langdedrosa.html" class="wikidpad">Langdedrosa Cyanwrath</a></span>. The blue Dragonborn challenged Balrick to a dual, watched on by his two guards. He instructed them to step in should Balrick's companions interfere.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The fight was swift and brutal. Balrick struck hard and fast, light flashing from his blade as it collided with his enemy. But it was not enough. Langdedrosa swung his colossal greatsword with ease, and within seconds, Balrick lay bloodied on the floor. The attempts by his companions to aide him having been quickly dealt with, and Batomius finding himself gravely injured as well, Daisy challenged Langdedrosa to another duel, one she would fight herself. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Quickly, however, it became clear that this challenge was only a slower way of dying. Batomius, out of magic save for one small healing spell, communicated telepathically to his ally, warning her to be ready to attack. He spoke the words of healing to Balrick, who woke but did not move, readying himself to attack from surprise. <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
With a flash of light, Batomius struck with his staff. It was met not with a roar of pain, but a roar of rage. Langdedrosa screamed at their lack of honor, even as Balrick struck a second blow against him. With a swing of his greatsword, he struck, once, then twice, both men falling to the cave floor, their lifeblood spilling onto the floor. Daisy, thinking quickly, ran to her allies, slipping healing berries into their mouths. Batomius, at the edge of death, spluttered, then stirred, but Balrick stared blankly, seeing something no one else could - seeing nothing ever again.<br class="wikidpad" />
